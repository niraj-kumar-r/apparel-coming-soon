## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Constraint Validation API

### What I learned

-   Learned about form validation with HTML5 constraints as well as the Constraint Validation API built-in in most browsers.

### Useful resources

-   [Client Side Validation - By MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This page by MDN is probably the best resource available online for this project.
